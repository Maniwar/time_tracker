## üéØ Why This Exists

Time doesn't just slip through our fingers‚Äîit gets absorbed by meetings, "quick questions," and context switching that never shows up in reports. Without data, these invisible hours become invisible problems.

**Universal Time Tracker** gives you the ammunition to prove what you already know: your team needs more people.
